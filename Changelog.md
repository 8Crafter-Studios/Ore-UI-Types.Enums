# v1.2.0

## Additions

-   Added the `WorldPlayerInfoBindingsPlatform` enum constant.

# v1.1.0

## Critical Fixes

-   Fixed a bug where the following enum constants were missing `as const` in their declaration, cauing the types of the values of their properties to be `number` instead of a number literal type, and causing their properties to not be labeled as read-only:
    -   `LeaveRealmsServerError`
    -   `KeyboardType`
    -   `StorageType`
    -   `FriendFavoriteStatus`
    -   `RealmsStoriesTimelineOptInStatus`
-   Fixed a bug where the `ScreenType` type always had an object type intersecting with it, instead of only when in `enum` mode.

## Additions

-   Added CommonJS support.
-   Added the `reverseNumericEnumMapping` function. When one of the enum constants from this package are passed into it, it will return the reverse mapping.

## Removals

-   The `package.json` file no longer has a `main` field.

# v1.0.0

-   Initial Release
